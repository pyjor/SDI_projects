"Type": "Expense",

"Project": "ACO",

"Name": "Shell",

"Ref": "12543",

"Categorization": "Car Gas",

Column 1: ‘ Date’
Date format:  YY-MM-DD

Read the file and extract the date from the file, if date not found, leave in blank.



Column 2: ‘Type’

This is filled with a fixed “Expense” never changes,



Column 3: ‘Project’

Sometimes this column will be empty, but how to fill it? When you read the file identify the State, normally it is near to the Name of the store. This is the list of projects we currently have:

[

  { "state": "AL", "Project": "ATU" },

  { "state": "AR", "Project": "ALR" },

  { "state": "CA", "Project": "APS" },

  { "state": "CA", "Project": "ARI" },

  { "state": "CA", "Project": "ARO" },

  { "state": "CO", "Project": "ALJ" },

  { "state": "IL", "Project": "EAS" },

  { "state": "KY", "Project": "AMA" },

  { "state": "MA", "Project": "MDS" },

  { "state": "MN", "Project": "ASC" },

  { "state": "MS", "Project": "AMC" },

  { "state": "MT", "Project": "AGL" },

  { "state": "NJ", "Project": "ATR" },

  { "state": "NY", "Project": "ASY" },

  { "state": "NY", "Project": "BAR" },

  { "state": "NY", "Project": "KEN" },

  { "state": "NY", "Project": "RGN" },

  { "state": "RI", "Project": "APR" },

  { "state": "SC", "Project": "ADE" },

  { "state": "WA", "Project": "AEP" },

  { "state": "WI", "Project": "ACO" }

]

So for example if the receipt was issued in WI that means this transactions belong to the “ACO” project. If it the receipt was issued in the state of CA that means it belongs to “ARO” Project. Long story shorty, identify the state it was issued and fill it with the correct project, NY is special we have a few project in that state, by deful when it is NY fill it with “BAR”. If you can’t idenfity which project is, leave blank



Column 4: “Payee”

For "Payee": "Example Vendor" identify the name of the store, and just add the name of the store, for example if it says "Palm Pantry #1", just

add "Palm Pantry" another example, if it says "Shell #2" just add "Shell", another example if it is 7-Eleven #125, just add "7-Eleven"





Column 5: “Reference”

For "Reference": "12345" field, always use the last 6 digits/characters, for EXAMPLE if in the invoice the reference number is:1234126t2342354123

what you gonna take is the last 6 digits 354123, if the ref number is shorter you can complete the number.  The Ref number could be “Invoice Number” or “Oder ID”, etc, etc, select a number that identifies the transaction
