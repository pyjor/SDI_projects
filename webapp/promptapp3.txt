  "Tax Type" : " ",
  "Line Type" : "Category",
  "Category" : "Travel Expenses:Travel meals",
  "Description" : "Meals - Sri",
  "qty": "1",
  "Rate": "1.40",
  "Amount" : "1.40",
  "Costumer": " ",
  "Class" : " ",
  "Tax Rate": "NON",
  "Memo": "Meals-Sri"
}

If invoice number/reference number cannot be found, leave it empty.
Defaults:
- "Post?" : "Yes"
- "Location": "SDI"
- "Tax Rate": "NON"
- "Costumer": " "
- "Line Type" : "Category"
- "Class": " "
- "Tax Type" : " "
- "Payment_method": "Credit Card"
- "Memo" and "Description" should be the same.

All FIELDS ARE MANDATORY, SOME OF THEM might be empty but they are mandatory and they keep the same order as in the example, no exceptions.
in the field "Description" : "Meals - Sri"  that is just an example, you read the photo and you can write a short description of the transaction
In the "Category" : "Travel Expenses:Travel meals" this is te account, ok these are the main accounts we use, you read de document and tell which account
can be better.

For "Payment account": "Sri" well, you read the image and try to identify which credit card was used, normally you see the last 4 digits
with the last 4 digits, please look into this list and based on last 4 digits select the correct CC for the "Payment account": "Sri" field


account_names = [
    "31041 SDI Credit Cards:Ali CC 7492-4108",
    "31066 SDI Credit Cards:Ali Sec CC 8557",
    "31065 SDI Credit Cards:Carl CC 7466",
    "31062 SDI Credit Cards:Credit Card",
    "31051 SDI Credit Cards:Edward CC 1783",
    "31054 SDI Credit Cards:Felipe CC 5390",
    "31047 SDI Credit Cards:Gustavo CC 2249",
    "31043 SDI Credit Cards:Hernan CC 1577",
    "31055 SDI Credit Cards:Jason CC 0678",
    "31052 SDI Credit Cards:Jason CC 0796",
    "31046 SDI Credit Cards:Juan CC 1315",
    "31061 SDI Credit Cards:Julian CC 0382",
    "31063 SDI Credit Cards:Lynnden CC 6254",
    "31053 SDI Credit Cards:Richard CC 0861",
    "31048 SDI Credit Cards:Saurabh CC 3221",
    "31049 SDI Credit Cards:Srinidhi CC 7342",
    "31064 SDI Credit Cards:Thomas CC 6213",
    "31042 SDI Credit Cards:Zee CC 7500"
]

for example if you find in the receipt that the transaction was made with a credit card ending 0861 that means it is "Payment account": "31053 SDI Credit Cards:Richard CC 0861". If
you really really really can't find the right credit card then it would be "31062 SDI Credit Cards:Credit Card" this in the worst case when you couldn't find the right credit card

--


For the "Memo": "Meals-Sri" field, this is just an example, you read the receipt and write a short description on what it could be. if you see the
receipt is from a restaurant, then the memoo and description would be something like: "Memo": "Meals-Sri".

last but not least,


--
For "Payee": "Example Vendor" identify the name of the store, and just add the name of the store, for example if it says "Palm Pantry #1", just
add "Palm Pantry" another example, if it says "Shell #2" just add "Shell", another example if it is 7-Eleven #125, just add "7-Eleven"

--

-
For "Reference": "12345" field, always use the last 6 digits/characters, for EXAMPLE if in the invoice the reference number is:1234126t2342354123
what you gonna take is the last 6 digits 354123, if the ref number is shorter you can the complete number

--
For "Amount" : "1.40" field, well it is what it is, the total that was paid, but always double check if there is any tip added.
--
For the "Category" : "Travel Expenses:Travel meals" field, this is very very important, in this case this would be the account that we categorize,

So THIS IS AN EXAMPLE:

1. "Auto Expenses:Auto Gas & Fuel"  This one is used for Gas purchases, so if you identify that the transaction is for Car Gas then would be:
"Category" : "Auto Expenses:Auto Gas & Fuel" and the memo would be something like "Car Gas Purchase". Identify what is this then you compare to the list
I let below:

Never leave this field empty, if you are not sure which account to use, put the most likely for example if the transaction
is about clothing and there is no account for that, then use "Travel Expenses:Other Travel Expenses"

These are the most used accounts, you find the explanation in the name itself, but there also there is also aditional information for you.
